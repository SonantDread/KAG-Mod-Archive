	//That's it for the template class. You would usually add your code for abilities or attacks here.
	
	//If you wanna check if the player is pressing left click, use: if(this.isKeyPressed(key_action1))
	//Similarily, right click is: if(this.isKeyPressed(key_action2))
	
	//I can't really help or explain more. Making classes is hard and difficult. Every class is different, so there's no method to make every class.
	//Hope these files helped!
