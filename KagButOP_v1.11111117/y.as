The main reason i did this mod is becuase i have nothing else to do. 
It allows me to learn and get use to modding, as this is my second attempt.

I also enjoy playing chaotic stalemate games, reason being is that even if there is an object, i'd rather kill or do something stupid.

Looking at the folder names, you can already see it's stupid, which is good!

I have no clue why i did it this way, but it late to revert..
